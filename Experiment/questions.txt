1. My end goal is to create a portfolio website. That is what I am trying to accomplish. My inspiration was the website that was shared in class by Alessandra,  loved the clean and simple look. I also wanted to do the typing script into my homepage like they did. I found a typed.js library that I used.
The most frustrating part honestly was the side bar navigation for me. I tried many different ones to try and find the perfect one. I also had a weird trouble where I couldn't change the size of the font in the navigation when clicked. Thankfully, I was able to figure it out. I would say that was the most rewarding and also getting the typed.js to work.
Yes I would! I love trying out new things and discovering new stuff. This project is what I would describe freedom as haha! It was dope, I enjoyed it. I always wanted to make my own portfolio that is created with what I want!
I wouldn't change much, but i would for sure add more to it. Homepage may be a bit too bland and I need to add the links for the nav items to go to the new page.
