        The Miami Lighthouse is considered to be one of the top nonprofit
        organizations in the state and as I was working with them I was able to
        see that excellence at first-hand. The Miami Lighthouse takes pride in
        all of their work and care deeply about their own clients who feel as if
        many times they are left out and it’s a sad truth. While creating
        content for the Miami Lighthouse I quickly realized how the blind and
        visually impaired communities are very often left out on many things.
        One of the biggest things I worked on this semester was on their
        campaign which dealt with the 2020 election. Seeing how this year’s
        election was going to be an important one, you would think that
        candidates would keep all of the people in mind, but I was quick to find
        out how that wasn’t the case. Seeing how most of the candidate’s
        websites were not ADA compliant which means that most people who are
        blind and visually impaired won’t be able to have access to campaign
        websites. The blind and visually impaired community is one of the
        biggest, but if they don’t have easy access to simple things such as
        campaign websites they won’t be able to have their own views
        represented. This is especially important during the ongoing pandemic.

        you can download the media kit that I created. There you will find the
        content I created such as press releases, a newsletter, memos, pitches,
        a social media plan, blog/social media posts on a variety of platforms
        and visual elements like a brochure and flyer using creative services
        such as Adobe Suite and Canva.

        For my final project, I was tasked with creating a website for the UM
        campus LEED educational program. New buildings the UMiami are all U.S.
        Green Building Council's LEED(Leadership in Energy and Environmental
        Design) silver certified. The goal of this website is to showcase these
        LEED initiatives that UM's new buildings follow through a virtual
        experience. Using panoramic photos to show case these buildings and
        immerse users in a 360 experience. By

        can visit a site that I created for the project and view the wireframes
        and prototype!
